# Session 3

**Date:** 2026-02-07

**Prompt/Ask:** Similar to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`, add `.cursorrules` and `.windsurfrules`; later requested to record this work under ISSUE-1 without creating a new issue.

## Completed
- Added `.cursorrules` with required-reading, command-doc, manual quickstart, and workflow notes aligned to existing agent docs.
- Added `.windsurfrules` with the same workflow expectations for Windsurf-based agents.
- Backfilled logging by creating this session summary and updating the final issue summary.

## Current Status
- Done; post-completion documentation updates are now captured in the issue audit trail.

## Plan Coverage
- N/A. This was a documentation/admin update request.

## Files Changed
- `.cursorrules` - Added Cursor-specific repository guidance.
- `.windsurfrules` - Added Windsurf-specific repository guidance.
- `.issues/ISSUE-1/summary-3.md` - Added this session record.
- `.issues/ISSUE-1/summary.md` - Updated final summary to include these additions.

## Verification
- Reviewed `.cursorrules` and `.windsurfrules` to confirm they include required reading, command docs, manual quickstart, and notes sections.
- Confirmed `ISSUE-1` now includes this `summary-3.md` session record and an updated final `summary.md`.

## Next Steps
- None.
