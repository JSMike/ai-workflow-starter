## Summary

Copy the key parts of the AI workflow into a fresh repo and provide a clear starter structure for new projects.

## Prompt

"The AI-WORKFLOW for this project has been extremely useful in coordinating with the AI Agent, staying on task, and not losing context. I'd like to copy the key parts of this into a fresh repo ../ai-workflow-starter with sufficient details on how to get started using this flow for new projects. Copy/create all of the relevant files into that repo, and then create this prompt as issue #1 for that repo. Any copied files update to match a blank starter project."

## Requirements

- Include AI workflow docs and starter issue tracking structure.
- Ensure files are generic and suitable for a blank project.
- Record this prompt as issue #1.
