# Windsurf Rules

Guidance for Windsurf and other agents in this repository.

## Required Reading

Read these files before starting work:
- `AI-WORKFLOW.md` - Workflow and issue tracking (mandatory)
- `AI-README.md` - Project conventions (update for this repo)

## Command Docs

Command docs live in:
- `.codex/commands/` (`issue.md`, `workflow.md`)
- `.claude/commands/` (`issue.md`, `workflow.md`)

If your environment supports `/issue` or `/workflow`, use them. Otherwise update `.issues/` manually per `AI-WORKFLOW.md`.

## Manual Quickstart

1. `.issues/ISSUE-N/issue.md`
2. `.issues/ISSUE-N/plan.md`
3. `.issues/ISSUE-N/summary-1.md` (after work)
4. `.issues/ISSUE-N/summary.md` (when done)
5. update `.issues/index.md`

## Notes

- Keep `.codex/commands/*` and `.claude/commands/*` in sync.
- Session summaries are mandatory after any work.
- Do not stage or unstage files unless explicitly asked.
